Brainstorm Bin:
    + all mage system
        - spells you can learn (unlimited spells to learn)

        - health
    + only spells
        - 
    + conjure up weapons
        - dagger (can be dual wielded)
        - sword
        - bow
    + set up camp to heal and restore status (bonus stat can occur)
        - little message about the (unique) scenery
    + GAAAYYYYYYY
        - have gay characters, won't hook up with characters if they're not into them
        - few characters that connect with the player rather than a pool of lookalikes
        - (style) are you? feminine, masculine, or androgynous
    + story
        -

            iv) they can attack with spells
            v) use defense spells
            vi)
