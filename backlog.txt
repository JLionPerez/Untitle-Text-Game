Brainstorm Bin:
    + set up camp to heal and restore status (bonus stat can occur)
        - little message about the (unique) scenery
    + conjure up weapons
        - dagger (can be dual wielded)
        - sword
        - bow
    + GAAAYYYYYYY
        - have gay characters, won't hook up with characters if they're not into them (dating will be implemented? maybe not, just want as part of identity somehow)
        - few characters that connect with the player rather than a pool of lookalikes (would need to have extra stories for the characters might have to do it later)

Workflow:
    1) Implement mechanics of player
        a) player mechanics, make player class and what they can do
            v) use defense spells to block incoming attacks from enemies
    2) Develop spells
        d) use spells on environment also not just in battles
            ex. using fire based spells to burn down vines blocking path
    3) Either develop characters or the story itself
