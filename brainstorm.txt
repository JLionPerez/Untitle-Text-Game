Brainstorm Bin:
    + all mage system
        - spells you can learn (unlimited spells to learn)
        - mana
        - health
    + only spells
    + GAAAYYYYYYY
        - have gay characters (they have their own pronouns at least in the beginning)
        - (style) are you? feminine, masculine, or androgynous
    + story
        - have main characters to progress through the plot

            ii) they can execute spells
            iii) they can heal
            iv) they can attack with spells
    2) Develop spells (need to add cost of mana/health)
        a) attack spells
            i) flame (aoe) adds burn effect for 3 turns
            ii) frost (single) freezes enemy for 2 turns
            iii) fireball (single) big mana cost + big damage + adds burn effect for 2 turns
            iv) blizzard (aoe) big mana cost + adds frostbite increasing enemies' chance to miss for 3 turns
            v) summon golem (single) stays continously beating up baddies for 3 turns

            iii) holy water (debuff + damage + mana) very rare spell, only applies if player dies within 4 turns after applying this spell, prepares player for inevitable death beforehand, revives player + full mana + full health
        c) mana restoring spells
            i) fairy tears +15 mana points
            ii) angels blessing +30 mana points
    3) develop enemies

        b) knomes/goblins?
    4) develop characters
    5) develop setting
        a) garden/caves?
